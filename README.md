## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Through this project i learned how to create the skeleton of my design using HTML div tags and using CSS to create a responsive design

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="main">
  <div class="heading-component">
    <p>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</p>
  </div>
  <div class="body-component">
    <p>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
  </div>
</div>
```
```css
.container {
    position: relative;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    max-width: 320px;
    width: 100%;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to further develop my CSS skills, especially regarding flexbox and grids for a responsive design.
